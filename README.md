   For Linux type "python3 main.py" or "python gui.py" (depends on the version you want to use)
   For Mac type "python3 main.py" or "python gui.py" (depends on the version you want to use)

## Using the programm
1. First you have to paste the file path of the source playlist file (wpl or m3u)
2. After that you have to type in the target file path
3. Now the programm should start working

## Extra information
